# Uninformative Error Messages in MATLAB

This repository demonstrates a scenario where MATLAB's error messages are not very informative, making debugging difficult.  The example shows how to use debugging tools to identify the root cause of such errors.  The solution focuses on employing `dbstop if error` to pause execution at the point of failure, enabling examination of the variables and execution flow to better understand and resolve the issue.

## Bug Report
The primary problem is that standard MATLAB error messages may lack sufficient context, especially in complex code, making pinpointing the error's source difficult. This is exemplified by a function that handles input validation, but its error message is too generic.

## Solution
Using `dbstop if error` in MATLAB is highly recommended. This command halts execution immediately when an error occurs, allowing you to examine the stack trace, local variables, and the current execution environment to identify the exact location and cause of the error.  This context-rich debugging approach is crucial for resolving errors with non-descriptive or vague messages.
